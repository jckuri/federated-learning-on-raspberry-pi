# Federated Learning with Raspberry PI (PySyft)
Scholars from the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge by [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) working together to implement [this](https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/) tutorial by [Daniele Gadler](https://github.com/DanyEle) from [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/).

We will set up PySyft on two Raspberry Pis and learn how to train a Recurrent Neural Network on a Raspberry Pi via PySyft.

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of using federated learning on a Raspberry Pi (RPI) is to build the model on the device so that data does not have to be moved to a centralized server. In addition to increased privacy, FL works well for Internet-of-Things applications because training can be done on the device instead of having to pass data between devices and a centralized server.

This project, which implements the OpenMined tutorial simulates the process using 2 RPIs to classify a person's surname with its most likely language of origin.
